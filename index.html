            <p class="first-car-info">Not a production car, this is more or less a street-legal version of the
                track-only McLaren P1 GTR.
                Converted by the British firm Lanzante, who bought the original P1 built by McLaren, it was made keeping
                in mind a select group of buyers in the U. S., Japan, U. K., and the UAE. This car has a lot in common
                with the P1 GTR and the legendary McLaren F1 road car. For example, the gold plating surrounding the
                engine bay with a 3.8 liter twin-turbo V-8. It is much smarter than the P1 GTR. Not only does it weigh
                132 pounds (60 kg0 less than the P1 GTR, but its modified rear wing and enlarged front splitter join
                with the dive planes to generate 40% increased downforce as compared to the P1 GTR. The awesomeness of
                the aerodynamics can be witnessed where it is made for- on track, where it can produce 1000 horsepower.
                As of yet, only five units have been built, all of them being sold. </p>

            <p class="second-car-info">
                Built to celebrate the company’s 50th birthday, ‘Veneno’ literally means poison in Spanish, and well,
                the design does look deadly. Looking almost like an alien space capsule, this car can reach speeds that
                can give one of those a run for their money, literally. The 6.5 liter V12 with a seven-speed single
                clutch ISR automated manual transmission can spin at 8,400 rpm to yield 740 horsepowers and 507
                pound-feet of torque, meaning that the car can do a 60 mph at 2.9 seconds! The monoque is heavily
                inspired by the LP700-4 Aventador, and is made of carbon fiber. The sprung portion is placed on the top
                of a pushrod-actuated suspension, and its total dryweight of this carbon-fiber vehicle is a mere 3,285
                pounds, although it is driven by a full all-wheel-drive system. Only 9 units being made, the biggets
                problem of these cars is their crazy resells rates- one was sold at $11 millions! It was the most
                expensive car in the world ever produced upon its introduction, and only three being available to
                customers in the first lot, there was a crazy scramble to get hands on the remaining ones.

            <p class="third-car-info">The most expensive street-legal production car in the world, this is coated with
                real diamonds. Yes, you read that right. ‘Trevita’ is an abbreviation translating into ‘three whites’.
                The carbon fibers are indeed coated with a diamond dust-impreganted resin, called the Koenigsegg
                Proprietary Diamond Weave. This technology transformed the fibres from the traditional black to shining,
                silvery white, making the bodywork of this car renowned throughout for its unique design and perfection.
                And that’s not all. Beneath the coating is a 4.8 liter, dual-supercharged V8 having a total output of
                1,004 horsepower and 797 pound-feet of torque. This makes it well-equipped at overtaking semis in the
                freeway. This car comes with a one-of-its-kind dual carbon rear wing, iconell exhaust system, airbags,
                ABS powered carbon ceramic brakes, paddle-shift, infotainment system, chronometer instrument cluster,
                tires monitoring systems along with a hydraulic system. Only three cars of this model had been initially
                decided upon, before getting reduced to two, because the carbon fibre made it too difficult and
                time-consuming for regular manufacture. </p>

            <p class="fourth-car">7. Pagani Huayra Imola – $5.4 million </p>
            <p class="fourth-car-info">Named after a famous Italian racing track, Huayra Imola’s technical specs have
                long been shrouded in mystery. The manufacturer has recently released the technical details of the
                supercar. Mercedes-AMG developed a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V12 engine specifically for Pagani. The engine
                pumps magnificent 827 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. The seven-speed automatic gearbox makes
                Imola more powerful than any other car in the Pagani Huayra series. Some of the spectacular features of
                the car include a large seven-section diffuser, a large roof scoop, more definite side-skirts, a shark
                fin, and integrated spotlights. The gargantuan wing installed at the back of the car makes it look more
                aggressive. The engineers developed an exclusive paint finish to shed extra weight. They revised the
                geometry of the design to give ultimate suspension to the car. They installed active dampers along with
                a front-lift system to keep the car stable under hard acceleration and braking. Huayra Imola also
                features an improved Brembo brake package and especially designed Pirelli Trofeo R tires. Only five
                examples of Pagani Huayra Imola would ever be produced. And each is priced at a staggering $5.4 million.

            <p class="fifth-car-info">Bugatti Divo followed after the immense success of Chiron, however with exotic and
                much more exclusive specs. As the creators boast, Bugatti Divo is the most agile and dynamic car they’ve
                ever created. The car generates 456kg downforce at the top speed. The extra drag produced by the
                aerodynamic elements has reduced the top speed of Divo to 236mhp, 25mph lower than Chiron’s. With 1500
                horsepower, Divo accelerates from 0 to 62mph in 2.4 seconds. While Chiron focused on top speed, Divo
                offers enhanced agility and driving dynamics. The redesigned exhaust system of the car features quad
                exhaust pipes and a retractable rear wing. To provide an improved downforce, Divo is equipped with a
                NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car. The car also uses improved radiator
                cooling for the brakes, which is achieved by two vents, one installed on the bonnet and the other on the
                front wheel arches. Inside the car, the steering wheel is embellished with soft faux suede. The interior
                also
            <p class="extra"> features Alcantara upholstery. To save weight, the storage lockers and center console have
                been
                removed. And a carbon-fiber trim has been used throughout the interior. What Divo retains from Chiron is
                its quad-turbocharged W16 engine. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission has been retained too.</p>

            <p class="sixth-car-info">Built by a German luxury car manufacturer, Maybach Exelero is known for its
                peculiar design
                and price tag of $8 million. Only one model of the car has ever been produced. Maybach Exelero combines
                the elegance and quality of high-end limousines. The car is powered by a V-12 twin-turbo engine that
                produces 725 pounds of torque at 2500 RPM. The engine, mounted at sixty degrees, incorporates 12 valves
                with 3 cylinders each. Exelero boasts a top speed of 218mph and can accelerate from 0 to 62mhp in just
                4.4 seconds. The car was commissioned by a tire company that wanted to test its new line of tire family.
                Needless to say, the tires of Exelero are of magnificent quality. Each tire features a code, specifying
                its dimensions and limitations. And to prevent the wheels from locking up during braking, the car is
                equipped with ABS. The interior of the car is embellished with dark and red leather, neoprene, and
                glossy black carbon fiber. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero was featured in singer Jay-Z’s music video. And the
                only model of this car is owned by rapper Birdman.</p>

            <p class="seventh-car-info">With this supercar, Bugatti pays homage to its 110-year old legacy. The word
                ‘Centodieci’ means 110 in Italian. The car is equipped with an 8.0-liter W-16 engine capable of
                producing a
                staggering 1600 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.4 seconds, making Centodieci
                the
                quickest-accelerating Bugatti currently on the road. The design of the car is heavily influenced by
                Romano
                Artioli’s iconic EB110, a supercar produced in the early ‘90s. Without losing the charm and character of
                EB110, Centodieci is designed to serve as the modern interpretation of shape and technology. Its angular
                silhouette, glass engine cover, small horseshoe grille, and air vents take inspiration from EB110. The
                absence of the C-shaped pillar gives this car an even cooler look. The aerodynamics of Centodieci allows
                for
                dynamic lateral acceleration. The distinct modern aesthetic of the supercar makes up for its slightly
                lower
                top speed (of 379khp) than Bugatti Chiron. Centodieci is 44
            <p class="extra"> pounds lighter than Bugatti Chiron. The cabin of
                the car is a perfect balance between sportiness and luxury. The flat-bottom steering wheels, blue
                controls,
                premium sound system, and a cooled glovebox are some of the many features of Centodieci’s luxurious
                interior.</p>

            <p class="eight-car-info">Before you gasp at the price, do note that this car is off the markets. That’s
                because it was made on the recommendations of one specific customer whose name the company has refused
                to divulge. A company famous for its luxurious rollouts, there were only 4,000 Rolls Royce cars
                manufactured in 2016! This particular exclusive car comes with its custom coach work, reminiscent of the
                royal carriages of yore. Probably modeled on the Wraith, this car can seat only two people (see what
                they mean by being exclusive?). The sunroof is fully panoramic, tapering down sharply like those of the
                racing yachts, as per the orders of the customer. Something very cool about the interior handcrafted
                with wood and leather are the hidden attaché cases for holding laptops behind each door. Not much else
                is available on this most expensive car in the world, except that it is based on the 1920s and 30s
                models, and looks like a yacht from the back. The owner does happen to be a collector of super-yachts
                and private planes. </p>

            <p class="ninth-car-info">With a unique look, HP Barchetta adds to the incredible legacy of Pagani Zonda.
                Horacio Pagani, the founder of Pagani Automobili, named this magnificent edition of Zonda as Barchetta
                for its cunning resemblance to a ‘little boat.’ The blue-tinted frame of the car is formed entirely of
                carbon fiber. The chassis is developed from what Pagani claims to be the material called ‘Carbo
                Titanium’. The car, made ultralight by the material, offers a thrilling experience of the speed to its
                driver. Though Pagani has never released the vehicle’s official performance specifications, some sources
                speculate the supercar boasts a top speed of 338 km/h. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 kph in just 3.4
                seconds. This open-top convertible supercar stands only some 21 inches tall at its tallest. It’s
                equipped with a huge ventilated 380m disc on all four corners and six-piston calipers to wipe the speed
                and slow down the car. Its <p class="extra">extravagant price tag of $17.5 million makes it the top car on this list. But
                chances are you’ll never get your hands on the car as only three of these vehicles will ever be made.
                And needless to say, all three have been booked already. One of the models is reserved by the founder
                Pagani himself as a present for his 60th birthday.</p>

            <p class="tenth-car-info">Bugatti has unveiled the “La Voiture Noire” translated as “the black car” made
                entirely from carbon fiber. The first one of the Limited Edition car has been sold for $19 million to
                Ferdinand Piech, the owner of VW group. Designed by Salome Etienne, it is inspired by its predecessors
                Veyron and Chiron and the pre-war Type 57SC Atlantic. Powered by an 8 liter, 16 cylinder engine that
                churns out a jaw-dropping 1,500 HP the car should be able to reach above 450 km/h. Bugatti has refused
                to reveal its performance specifications. The front is dominated by the trademark horseshoe-shaped
                Bugatti grill and blends into an aerodynamically swept-back design with sloping windscreen and
                wrap-around tail lamps.</p>
